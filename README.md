### Tech & Approaches
* Materialize
  * We used materialize CSS framework

### Fails and Wins
* Carole
  *  Fail:  Had problems with fields not updating in the job table due to lots of syntax errors.
  *  Win:   All front end functionality working.
            No Github issues with team members.
* Mimi
  * Troubleshooting deploying heroku was tough but I'm glad I started early with it.
  *  I really wanted to get a working timestamp and it kept braking everything.
* Brandon
  * Struggles: I had a few bugs trying to get the CRUD routes working. I consulted google and got the php files set up.
  * Win: Getting the initial php files set up.

## Additionally, we would like each group member to answer at least one of the following questions:
 * What went well for your group?  No Github issues.
 * What was your groups biggest struggle? - We had some issues getting the app to work in heroku. Mimi did a great job of figuring out the issue.
 * What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most? - We were able to easily pull each others changes from github. It made collaboration pretty seamless.
 * What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didnâ€™t anticipate?  That we had no issues!
